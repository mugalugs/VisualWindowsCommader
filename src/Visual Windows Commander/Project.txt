== Tasks
 -/ Rename to Visual Window Commander
 -# Display order
 -# Select window (nearby, select closest in listbox)
 -# Click on new location on panel
 -/ Drag and drop windows
   -/ Remember drag start location for more intuitive experience
 -# Move ghost window to new location (move window in thread, throttled?)
 -/ Panel refresh
   -/ Double buffer
 - UWP apps have their own rules likely due to the background/sleep ability
   - Check extended styles?
   - Check transparency/opacity
     * Inconclusive
   - Likely need to check if the process is suspended
     * Dear mother of god, why is it so hard/slow, no easy win32 call to get thread state, .net method is like racing a F1 on a turtle
	 * UWP seem to go into a suspended state after sleeping (Mail / Calculator / Store)
	 * Threads go into Wait/UserRequest which unfortunetly is the same for normal processes as well
 -/ Periodic window data update (new / closed windows)
 -/ Periodic update current window data
   -/ Position update every frame
 -/ Refresh window bounds
 - Keep aspect ratio of the virtual screen?
 - Padding for some white space
 - Panning, Zoom, Fit All, Home (Middle mouse, mouse scroll, space, home)
 -/ Multiple monitor support
   * Goodbye performance
   -# Need to move all of the calculations to a worker thread(s)
   * Turns out GetWindowContext is quite expensive, removed, unused anyway
     * Oddly only when there are more than one screen though
   * Also reordered the if before GetWindowInfo, no need to get info if the window name is empty
 -/ Added a cross in the center of windows and line drawn to it
   * Makes it more obvious which window is selected and how
 * Updated to 30 FPS
